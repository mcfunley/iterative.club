      <h1>Making Big Changes</h1>
      <p>
        This is a section from a video I did for O'Reilly back in 2015 called <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920040149.do">Data Driven Products</a>. I think it's pretty good as a standalone set of case studies of how you might go about making changes to a web product if you care about not totally screwing up.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you like this you might also want to look at <a href="http://datadriven.club">Data Driven Products Now!</a>, which explains how you'd go about using data to inform the product discovery phase.

              If you’ve worked in technology for a while, you’ve probably worked on at least one release that was a lot of effort, but that didn’t go as planned. <br /><br />Maybe not a failure as spectacular as this one—Digg pretty famously released a major redesign called “v4” that basically led to the downfall of the entire company.

              A/B testing is a great way to measure objectively whether a given release is good or not. <br /><br />A/B testing is great at optimizing a website or a web page that already exists. What do we do if we want to make something new?

              In some circles A/B testing is associated with unimportant changes. <br /><br />Back in 2009 Douglas Bowman somewhat <a href="http://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html">famously rage quit Google design</a>, leaving a rant about optimization. Among other things.

              He complained about debating minuscule design decisions, for example testing 41 different shades of blue..<br /><br />I certainly commiserate with Douglas’s workplace angst. And I don’t find it hard to believe that engineers running the asylum is a factor at Google. <br /><br />It’s hard for me to completely condemn Google’s behavior without knowing all of the details. At Google’s scale, a shade of blue may very well be worth millions of dollars.

              A/B testing can still be used to measure the difference between two things, even if the differences are large. <br /><br />A/B testing can tell you whether or not where you’re standing now is better or worse than where you were. Even if you’ve redesigned everything and you’re metaphorically standing on a different hill now.

              An argument I’ve heard from people is that you shouldn’t bother A/B testing something if you’re making a big change. I think that you shouldn’t stand for this. <br /><br />But they are right that there are problems with A/B testing for big changes. The problem isn’t that measurement is impossible.

              The problem is that you’ve made many changes. A single measure of whether it’s better or worse can’t tell you which change, or which set of changes made together caused the difference.

              In our metaphors so far, we’ve assumed that we can actually perceive our environment. This is not really how it works. You can’t see the mountains, you have to try to infer your relationship to them. <br /><br />When you release a test that’s a radical change and you measure it to be worse,

              This was motivated by a couple of things. One primary reason we wanted to do it was because we thought we could deliver more items, faster. And Google and Microsoft had published some research suggesting that performance improvements in search had a real impact on conversion rates.

              It had accumulated a lot of different use cases. We wanted to remove the dropdown, but doing that now meant that we had to satisfy the problems that it was solving in other ways. And there were now a bunch of different problems to solve.<br /><br />We orchestrated removing the dropdown as a series of many small, individual experiments.

              We were basically following the first strategy—we were making incremental progress, release by release, removing one use case of the search dropdown and replacing it with something else as we went. <br /><br />We made missteps, but we kept our progress and kept iterating towards our ultimate goal, which was removing the search dropdown.

              But if we’d done that, we would have released features like that secondary search bar on item pages. That sounded like a reasonable idea to us, but it only confused people. <br /><br />If we’d done the mega-release and incorporated this, we might have been in that situation again where things were worse, but we’d made so many changes that we couldn’t figure out what was wrong.<br /><br />Since we’d done many small, tactical releases, we noticed this and removed it.

              A thing that you have to understand about Etsy is that it has fairly natural product scheduling constraints. The product process works on a cycle that’s driven by the holiday season.

              Like I said, the listing page is a really complicated page. It might not look so bad, but there are so many different things it has to do depending on what kind of item is being shown, where it is in the world, where the visitor to the page is in the world, and so on.<br /><br />Our strategy for dealing with this was to only recreate some of the necessary functionality with the new designs. If we recreated all of the listing page’s functionality with a new design right away, that would be a ton of work up front. And it would most likely be the case that our first attempt at changing the page would not be better than what already existed.

              So we budgeted the year up until the end of June to try a lot of different radical redesigns of the listing page. But our goal was to eventually find a release candidate that was pretty close in terms of purchases to the existing page by July. That was so that we would have enough time left in the year’s product cycle to polish the page, get it to complete parity in terms of features, and to do some minor optimizations.

              Eventually we found a release candidate that was not much worse than our existing listing page in terms of purchases.<br /><br />It was a little worse in terms of user registrations—but we fixed those issues during our fall polishing cycle. One of the things that we discovered while doing this was that we had inadvertently removed this blue feature that only signed out users see—this encourages new visitors to like the item, which leads a lot of them to register. <br /><br />If we hadn’t budgeted for time to polish our finished product and to find these mistakes, we probably would not have figured this out, and we wouldn’t have been able to release the new page.

              As it turned out the new page was significantly better in terms of purchases than the old one—it increased conversion by almost 5%. On that page, for Etsy, 5% is a massive amount of money. <br /><br />This was the strategy we were following. We released a ton of new redesigns, expecting most of them not to work. But we did stumble onto one that was alright, and we optimized that until it was much better than what we had.
